# HealthCare Project

## TheraMe 
- A digital twin of a patient, enriched with data (starting from self-perception, adding synchronisation with sleep trackers&HR and finishing with a precise model encorporating medical imaging). Patient - therapist Interaction is performed via animated digital twin.


### Concept description

A digital twin app - a user/patient model enriched with constantly updated data. 
It's a persona / creature for interaction btw a patient and a psychologist with a option of peers support when two users are matched similar to dating 
For the mental health the digital twin concept could be developed incrementally: 
a. A self-perception avatar from templates 
b. An adjusted model when a patient adds self measurements 
c. A model enriched with RPM data when/ if a patient grant permissions (feel stressed from HR, insomnia from sleep tracker etc) 
d. A model updated with a Computer vision algorithms when/if a patient make a selfie
